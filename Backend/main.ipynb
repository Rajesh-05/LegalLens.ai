All personal property at the Property is hereby subject to a lien in favor of Management for payment of all sums due hereunder, to the maximum extent under law. Upon the adjudication of Resident in Bankruptcy, or if any facts contained in Resident's application are untrue or misleading, then, upon the happening of any of said events, Resident shall be in default hereunder and Management may, at its option, immediately terminate this Agreement by written notice to Resident. In the event of a default by Resident, Management may elect to (i) continue this Agreement and enforce all of Management's rights and remedies hereunder, including the right to recover the rent as it comes due, or (ii) at any time, terminate all of Resident's rights hereunder and recover from Resident all damages Management may incur by reason of the breach of this Agreement, including the cost of recovering the Property, and including the worth at the time of termination, or at the time of an award should a suit be instituted to enforce this provision, of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the term exceeds the amount of such rental loss which Resident proves could be reasonably avoided.\n",
    "15.\tABANDONMENT: Anytime the Property is left unoccupied for more than seven (7) days while rent remains unpaid without notice to Management, Management may consider the Property abandoned. Management may, at its option, declare this Agreement forfeited and re-rent said premises without any liability whatsoever. Resident shall be obligated to pay based on the balance of the rental agreement or the early termination requirement, whichever is greater. If Resident removes or attempts to remove any personal property from the premises other than in the usual course of continuing occupancy, without having first paid Management all monies due, Management shall have the right, without notice, to obtain an injunction to stop removal as Management has an attachment interest in the personal belongings of the non-paying Resident. Management shall also have the right to remove, store or dispose of any of Resident's personal property remaining on the premises after the termination of this agreement. Any such personal property shall be considered Management's property, and title thereto shall vest in Management.\n",
    "Resident's Initials \n",
    "16.\tCROSS DEFAULT: If Resident has entered into any other agreements concerning Property and Resident defaults on any provisions of those agreements, then this Agreement shall also be considered in default and, at the option of Management, this Agreement may be voided.\n",
    "17.\tREMEDIES CUMULATIVE: All remedies under this Agreement or by law or equity shall be cumulative. In the event that either Management or Resident brings legal action to enforce the terms hereof or relating to the rental Property, the prevailing party shall be entitled to all costs incurred in connection with such action including reasonable attorney's fees. In the event a collection agency becomes necessary to collect any accounts due on this Agreement, Resident agrees to pay said commission. If any term or provision of this Agreement or application thereof to any person shall be held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.\n",
    "18.\tNO ESTATE IN LAND: This Agreement shall create the relationship of landlord and tenant between Management and Resident; no estate shall pass out of Management; Resident has only a usufruct and not an estate for years.\n",
    "19.\tMORTGAGEE'S RIGHTS: Resident's rights under this Agreement shall be subject to any bonafide mortgage or deed to secure debt, which is now or shall hereafter be placed on Property.\n",
    "20.\tMANAGEMENT'S PERMISSION OR CONSENT: If any provision of this Agreement requires the written permission or consent of Management as a condition to any act of Resident, such written permission or consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of Management and/or may contain such conditions as Management deems appropriate and shall be effective only so long as Resident complies with such conditions. Moreover, any written permission or consent given by Management to Resident may be modified, revoked, or withdrawn by Management at any time, at Management's sole discretion, upon written notice to Resident.\n",
    "21.\tNOTICES: Any notice required by this Agreement, except as otherwise set forth shall be in writing and shall be deemed to be given if delivered personally or mailed via first class mail.\n",
    "(a)\tIf to Resident, to the Property or the last known address of Resident;\n",
    "(b)\tIf to Management, to the address as contained in Paragraph 3.\n",
    "22.\tACCURACY AND RESPONSIBILITY: Management has relied upon the information contained in Resident's application to enter into this Agreement. Resident warrants that their rental application is fine, complete and accurate. Resident agrees that if he/she has falsified any statement in the rental application, Management has the right to terminate this Rental Agreement immediately and further agrees that Management shall be entitled to retain any performance fee and any prepaid rents as fair and just liquidated damages. Resident further agrees in the event Management exercises its option to terminate this Rental Agreement, he/she will remove him/herself, family and possessions from the Properly within 24 hours of notification by Management. Resident further agrees to indemnify Management for any damages to Property including, but not limited to, the cost of making residence suitable for renting to\n",
    "23.\tINDEMNIFICATION: Management shall not be liable for any damage or injury to Resident, or any other person, or to ary property, occurring on the Property, or any part thereof, or in common areas thereof, unless such damage is the proximate result of the negligence or unlawful act of Management, his agents, or his employees. Resident does hereby indemnify, release, and save harmless Management and Management agents from and against any and all suits, actions, claims, judgments, and expenses arising out of or relating to any loss of life, bodily or personal injury, properly damage, or other demand, claim or action of any nature arising out of or related to this Agreement or the use of this Properly and premises.\n",

      "As a newbie to income tax returns, understanding the different forms can be a bit daunting. Let's break down ITR 2 in simple terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is ITR 2?**\n",
      "ITR 2 is an Income Tax Return form used in India by individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) to file their tax returns with the Income Tax Department. It's designed for taxpayers whose financial situation is a bit more complex than what the simpler ITR 1 form covers, but **does not include any income from a business or profession**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it this way: if ITR 1 is for those with very straightforward income (like just a salary and one house property), ITR 2 is for those who have a few more types of income or assets, but aren't running a full-fledged business or profession.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Who is eligible to file ITR 2?**\n",
      "You generally need to file ITR 2 if you are an individual or HUF and your total income includes any of the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Income from Salary or Pension.**\n",
      "*   **Income from House Property:** This includes income from more than one house property. Even if you own two or more houses, even if one is vacant, you'd file ITR 2.\n",
      "*   **Capital Gains:** This is income from selling investments or property, whether short-term or long-term capital gains (e.g., from selling shares, mutual funds, real estate).\n",
      "*   **Income from Other Sources:** This category covers things like interest from bank accounts, dividends (especially if high-value or from multiple sources), winnings from lotteries, horse races, or online games, and income from virtual digital assets (like cryptocurrency).\n",
      "*   **Foreign Assets or Foreign Income:** If you have any assets outside India (like a foreign bank account or property) or earn income from foreign sources, you must file ITR 2. This also applies to Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and Residents Not Ordinarily Resident (RNORs).\n",
      "*   **Agricultural Income:** If your agricultural income is more than ₹5,000.\n",
      "*   **Director in a Company or Investor in Unlisted Equity Shares:** If you are a director of a company or have invested in unlisted equity shares.\n",
      "*   **Total Income Exceeding ₹50 Lakhs:** If your total annual income is above ₹50 lakh.\n",
      "*   **Clubbing of Income:** If the income of another person (like a spouse or minor child) needs to be combined with your income, and that income falls into any of the above categories, you can use ITR 2.\n",
      "*   **Carrying Forward/Setting Off Losses:** If you have losses from previous years that you want to carry forward or set off against current income, ITR 2 is often required.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Who is NOT eligible to file ITR 2?**\n",
      "You cannot file ITR 2 if:\n",
      "*   You have income from \"Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\". If you have business income, you would typically file ITR 3.\n",
      "*   You are eligible to file ITR 1. While a taxpayer eligible for ITR 1 can also technically file ITR 2, it's generally recommended to stick to ITR 1 for simplicity if your income sources allow it, as ITR 2 is more complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What kind of income does it cover?**\n",
      "ITR 2 covers a broader range of income sources compared to ITR 1. It has specific schedules to report details for:\n",
      "*   **Salary Income (Schedule S)**\n",
      "*   **Income from House Property (Schedule HP)**\n",
      "*   **Capital Gains (Schedule CG)** (from sale of shares, mutual funds, property, etc.)\n",
